	</div>
	<br>
	<div>
	<p class="bodtxt"><b>Amidst massive protests</b> around the United States and the world, on March 19, 2003, the U.S. began its invasion of Iraq. This week on Intercepted, Jeremy Scahill, Murtaza Hussain, and Iraqi journalist Ghaith Abdul-Ahad discuss the long-lasting impact of the war on Iraq and its people. Throughout the 20 years since the invasion, Iraq was torn to shreds by a gratuitous American occupation and a U.S.-fueled sectarian civil war. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians died as U.S. policy gave rise to Al Qaeda — and ultimately the Islamic State in Iraq.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">While many commemorations of this bloody anniversary focus on the 2003 invasion, the plans to destroy Iraq were launched much earlier and were supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. Scahill, Hussain, and Abdul-Ahad discuss life under Saddam Hussein, the lead-up to the U.S. invasion, the brutality of the occupation, and the systematic refusal to bring any accountability for those responsible.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">“Of course, the Iraqis could not believe that their new colonial masters had no clue, had done no planning and made no preparations for what was going to happen after they invaded the country,” Abdul-Ahad writes in his new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Stranger-Your-Own-City-Travels-ebook/dp/B0B45BMGM1" target="_blank">A Stranger in Your Own City: Travels in the Middle East’s Long War</a>.” “When the myth of an American-generated prosperity clashed with the realities of occupation, chaos and destruction followed. Resentment and anger swept the country and all the suppressed rage of the previous decades exploded.”</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Abdul-Ahad shares stories from his deeply human reporting on his personal journey from an architect living in Baghdad to a celebrated international journalist documenting the rise and fall of ISIS.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">Jeremy Scahill: </b>This is Intercepted.

	<p class="bodtxt">[Intro theme continues.]</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>Welcome to Intercepted. I’m Jeremy Scahill, senior correspondent and editor at large for The&nbsp;Intercept.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">Murtaza Hussain: </b>And I’m Murtaza Hussein, national security reporter for The&nbsp;Intercept.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>Well, Maz, this week marks 
20 years since the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq began — and 
coming up in the program, we’re going to be speaking to one of the great
 journalists to cover not just the invasion and occupation, but 
everything that came as a result of U.S. policy and the U.S. military 
incursion into Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But just a few thoughts off the bat on
 this 20th anniversary, Maz. I think that it’s hard to overstate how 
much of an epic crime this invasion and occupation was. It was like a 
crime-a-palooza of immense proportions. And I think a lot of history and
 context gets lost as we move further and further away from 2003 and 
that initial invasion.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But it’s important to remember that 
this was premeditated. It was pre-planned. This was a war of conquest in
 search of a justification when Bush and Cheney came into office. And, 
you know, the popular narrative that has emerged, even among the liberal
 media and the political class, certainly the Democrats in Congress, and
 increasingly, Republicans, was that the Bush administration got it 
wrong, they misled Congress, they misled the American people, but I 
think it’s really, really important to remember that this war did not 
start in 2003. I mean, you can make a case that the war started 60 years
 ago when the United States and the CIA helped to put Saddam Hussein in 
power. But just to drill it down to more recent history, you had the 
1991 Gulf War, where Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. But he did so after 
meeting with the U.S. ambassador, who essentially told him: “We don’t 
really have a position on Arab-Arab disputes.” And from Saddam’s 
perspective, he had been a U.S. ally, for quite a long time, certainly 
during the Iran-Iraq War.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But then you have the Gulf War, where 
the U.S. just bombed Baghdad back to sort of the Stone Age, in some 
ways, strikes at its civilian infrastructure, and then imposes the most 
sweeping regime of economic sanctions to that date in history.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And under both George H.W. Bush and 
Bill Clinton, you had regular bombing of Iraq under the guise of these 
so-called no-fly zones. And it culminates, then, in 1998, under Bill 
Clinton, when Democrats and Republicans alike passed the Iraq Liberation
 Act, which made regime change the official policy of the U.S. 
government. And what I think really gets lost is just how many American 
politicians promoted the myth that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass 
destruction. Certainly, the Republicans did that. And certainly, the 
Bush administration did it. But Nancy Pelosi did it, Joe Biden did it. 
Even Howard Dean, who, when he ran his insurgent campaign for the 2004 
Democratic Party nomination for president, was also promoting the myth 
that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. So for me, looking at this 
and looking back at these 20 years, it’s astonishing how all of these 
political figures who not only got it wrong, to sort of use the way that
 mainstream journalists and politicians talk about it now, that got Iraq
 wrong, but actually, were a part of the most catastrophic American 
imperial adventure in modern history.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And I think it’s very on the nose that
 Vladimir Putin gets indicted for war crimes in Ukraine by an 
international criminal court that the United States refuses to 
recognize, while Dick Cheney and George Bush are walking around as free 
men. I mean, it’s really indicative of the new world order that is being
 carved out now where the United States and its allies truly believe 
that there should be one set of rules that apply to them, and then 
another set of rules that apply to the Vladimir Putins of the world.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH:</b> Yeah, that’s absolutely 
correct. And I think it’s quite farcical, even though I do think that 
Vladimir Putin is committing a crime of aggression so far, it’s quite 
farcical to use the ICC, which is not recognized by the U.S., Russia or 
Ukraine as a tool or a weapon in a conflict between Russia, Ukraine, and
 the United States today.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">I think that after 9/11, there was an 
attempt to create a state of exception for the United States very 
formally, and Iraq was a demonstration of that. They say that the war 
was a mistake and there was bad intel. I don’t think that’s actually an 
accurate description of what happened in 2003 and the run-up to it and 
the national mood and the justifications. I think they knew very well, 
the justifications were very slim, and the claims that they were making 
just to bring the war about were poorly substantiated, but it didn’t 
really matter. They were trying to make an example of a particular 
country. And I think Iraq fell victim to that, because as you said, 
they’ve kind of gotten used to bombing Iraq or sanctioning Iraq, they 
had been in a quarter/30 percent state of war with Iraq as a default for
 a long time before that. So it was the easiest country to ramp it up, 
and to make a spectacle out of this country that they’re going to 
conquer and destroy. And they did, very thoroughly over the course of 
about a decade. So that’s what led itself to it.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And what I would say is that, like you
 said, they tried to create a different set of rules for the United 
States and other countries — they’re still trying to do that — but I 
think that effort was mortally wounded in Iraq, because the war went so 
poorly. It did not wind up being a demonstration of U.S. strength, other
 than destruction; creation was not an evidence, you know, today or 
during those years. The Iraq that exists today is a very, very sad, 
ramshackle place. Even from an American perspective, it’s very much in 
Iran’s orbit, which America doesn’t like, and Iran was very, very likely
 the next target or one of the next targets of the Iraq War had the 
invasion gone better. So I think that there’s still a very limping 
effort to create this double-tiered system of law. And I think to some 
degree, the U.S. still acts with impunity, and extrajudicially kills 
foreign citizens and foreign officials, without much recourse and then 
pivots back to the law to judge others’ actions. But I think that what 
we’re seeing now is the limits of that; there are more peer competitors,
 there are more powerful countries in Asia emerging and so forth, which 
will inevitably rebel at this double standard, which is very degrading 
and dehumanizing for the rest of the world when you think about it.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>Maz, how old were you when, when the invasion of Iraq happened?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH:</b> I was 16 years old.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS:</b> 16. Yeah. I had been going 
in and out of Iraq during Saddam Hussein’s reign, but I also wonder how 
you see different generations understanding the significance of Iraq. I 
mean, people that came up at the same time as you, what dynamics do you 
see at play, Maz?&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH: </b>Well, you know, at that 
time, it was very interesting, because I remember being quite young, but
 seeing the very quickly bloodthirsty, vitriolic environment which 
developed. I remember when I was a kid, there would be a lot of racial 
tensions over the war. And people would sometimes be provocatively 
cheering for how many Iraqis were killed in x number of days, or passing
 around snuff films, or videos, or images of torture and things like 
that. It was quite like, you can see how people could descend into 
madness over something.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And the question of what Iraq had to do with 9/11, why was the war 
being fought, it was not really important. It was a very primal thing: 
Someone roughly like the 9/11 people has to die in huge numbers and has 
to be a very big satisfying number for x amount of time. That’s, I 
think, what the real war was really about. I think that some more 
self-perceptive people in the bureaucracy, when the emotions cooled off 
and so forth, they tried to retrofit a different reasoning or rationale 
for it. But that was never very compelling and that certainly wasn’t a 
national mood at the time that the war took place.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So I think that, at that time, at some
 point, it kind of became clear as the big disaster, and a lot of 
Americans were dying in Iraq to which nobody on the American side really
 banked for; they didn’t think that was gonna happen. I think they had 
the 1991 Iraq War experience, and the Gulf War experience very much 
imprinted themselves on them culturally: war is one-sided, it happens in
 one direction and not the other. But when you’re occupying a country, 
it doesn’t really work out that way.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So I think that later on the 
perception soured, but now, very interestingly, what I see is that 20 
years after the invasion, there is a very marked effort to rewrite 
history again and say some of the things you said — that the war was 
maybe a mistake, or maybe even it was better — maybe it was a good 
thing. And the intelligence was a bit wrong, but there were some 
chemical weapons or something like that, which is actually not true. 
There were some decommissioned weapons we think that Saddam got from 
Reagan during the ’80s were found in Iraq, not weapons of mass 
destruction, as was said. I think Condoleeza Rice said famously, if 
people don’t remember it, there would be a mushroom cloud, perhaps, over
 the United States. That was the actual weapons of mass destruction 
narrative to justify the war.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So I think now they’re trying to 
rewrite it. And there are these younger generations coming up who don’t 
remember what happened and weren’t there, or didn’t see what was being 
said at that time, or how everyone was against the war, internationally,
 except for some people in the United States who were committed to it 
for many years.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So I think talking about it now is 
very important. Understanding what happened now is very important, 
because there are a lot of people who don’t even believe the U.S. can do
 something like that. They’re accustomed to other villains, or Vladimir 
Putin is a very big villain today. So, there’s a very fishbowl sort of 
mentality.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And I think what I’ve seen, and what 
you’ve seen, is that the U.S. is absolutely capable of killing people in
 the way that Vladimir Putin, or Bashar Assad, whoever else does. They 
are very capable of lying the way that they say other countries do, 
North Korea does, and so forth. All that is very possible in the context
 of the U.S. system; if we’re not very vigilant against it, and honest 
about it, and to the extent possible, trying to get some accountability 
for it, it’s gonna happen again. And it will happen within our 
lifetimes.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS:</b> I mean, this is a key 
point. And I mean maybe this is because I became a journalist, or 
started reporting on U.S. wars under Bill Clinton, but I’ve always held 
this mentality that the United States should be held not just to the 
standard of every other nation, but actually to a higher standard, 
because it proclaims itself, the sort of cop of the world, and says: Oh,
 we set the rules for this order. And I really think that what the U.S. 
did in Iraq was to essentially try to make that country into like one 
massive crucifix for the world to see; that this what we can do to a 
society, we can completely obliterate civilian infrastructure, we can 
dominate this country, we can fabricate a reason for war.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And I know it’s a talking point: Oh, Bush and Cheney should also be 
in The Hague — but no, really, they should. I mean, they really should.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And in fact, you can make a credible case for war crimes prosecution 
of multiple officials from the Bush administration following 
international jurisprudence standards. This isn’t just rhetoric. I mean,
 this was a government in Bush and Cheney, that not just systematically 
targeted the civilian infrastructure of Iraq, but also then, post 9/11, 
was operating gulags around the world, secret prisons, torturing people —
 torturing them in mercilessly cruel manners. There are still prisoners 
at Guantanamo right now!</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And let’s not just limit it to Bush 
and Cheney. I could make a very serious case that Barack Obama is a war 
criminal. I mean, just take one example. The first airstrike that Obama 
authorized in Yemen in 2009, toward the end of his first year in office,
 was an attack on the Yemeni village of al-Majalah, and 41 people were 
killed. The majority of them were women and children — and civilians. 
And they used internationally banned cluster munitions in that 
strike.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">The United States, under both 
Democrats and Republicans, has repeatedly committed crimes, that if 
someone like Vladimir Putin does it, rightly, the world says these are 
war crimes, and rightly the world says even a head of state should be 
prosecuted. But the fact is that, yes, Vladimir Putin belongs on trial. 
But if we’re going to get into the business of prosecuting heads of 
state, which I believe we should, then how is it possible that some of 
the most epic crimes in modern history that were committed by the nation
 that wants to be judge, jury, and executioner go entirely unmentioned, 
unprosecuted, unaddressed? I mean, this is a stain on the world.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And it’s remarkable that the 
indictment of Putin comes down, which I think pretty clearly is a 
justifiable indictment, not to mention other crimes he could be charged 
with and probably will be charged with, but the idea that it comes down 
right before the anniversary of Iraq, and George Bush has now been 
rebranded as the nice painter man, and gets to chum around with the 
Obamas and Ellen DeGeneres, I mean, it is just a shocking, cartoonish 
display of how grotesque this brand of American exceptionalism truly is,
 Maz.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH: </b>Yeah, I can’t take it seriously this ICC indictment, That was very, very farcical for all of the reasons you mentioned.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">I would prefer that if they’re going 
to act with complete illegality and impunity on their side, don’t 
pretend that you’re going to charge Vladimir Putin in a court of law 
that exists and is legitimate, and you recognize and so forth. The U.S. 
doesn’t even recognize the ICC, actually, so I don’t know what the 
pretense is of the whole spectacle —&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS:</b> Well, the Pentagon, when 
they got wind that this was heading in this direction, it was the 
Pentagon that started saying to the Biden administration: We can’t be 
cooperating in any of this.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And they were quite blunt about it because of the fear that these standards are going to then be applied to American personnel.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH:</b> It is absolutely comical and insane.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">I often say that international law 
doesn’t exist, and people will get mad at me — the international lawyers
 especially, because they don’t like it. And maybe it’s a bit of a 
provocative statement. But I think it actually is sort of true, if you 
think about it. That’s why I think the realist foreign policy people 
make a lot more sense. They’re like this is basically a gang of gang 
members, and they’re in conflict with each other, and maybe they’ll 
fight, maybe they’ll steal from each other, maybe they’ll kill some 
innocent people on the way.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">That’s fine. Don’t try to dress it up 
in this legal moral framework, which everyone knows doesn’t exist. And 
if it didn’t exist, you wouldn’t be trying to destroy the ICC or 
prosecute — or refuse to cooperate with them, as you said. It’s really a
 spectacle.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And the Iraq War was just the most 
blatant, large-scale example of that. As you said, there are many, many 
examples — since then, ongoing, undoubtedly going to happen in the 
future, since there’s been no accountability or sort of attempt to 
chasten people as a result of the Iraq War, seriously. You’d be very 
short sighted and very foolish to put your faith in international law if
 you’re looking at the world today, or thinking that’s going to help 
you, or that’s a thing that you can appeal to or exists. It simply 
doesn’t. It’s just a tool for powerful nations to deal with their 
enemies in one way or another.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">[Musical interlude.]</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>Well, Maz, we are joined 
now by one of the most brilliant and insightful journalists to document 
the U.S. invasion and occupation and everything that stemmed from this 
catastrophe, including the rise of both al Qaeda and ultimately ISIS in 
Iraq. His name is Ghaith Abdul-Ahad and he was born and raised in 
Baghdad.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">He’s not a professional journalist by 
training. In fact, up until the beginning of the invasion, he was an 
architect in Baghdad, and when U.S. tanks rolled into his home city 20 
years ago this week, he began working as a translator for a British 
journalist, and he swiftly worked his way to becoming one of the most 
respected journalists reporting from and about Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">His new memoir is a stunning 
achievement of narrative nonfiction and it offers all of us an 
opportunity to hear about life under Saddam Hussein’s regime, and its 
devastating and violent downfall. The book is called: “A Stranger in 
Your Own City: Travels in the Middle East’s Long War.”</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Ghaith takes us on a journey as he 
discovers his own country as it was thrust into a vortex of violence and
 sectarian bloodshed. It spans the period from the Iran-Iraq War in the 
1980s, to the ascent and downfall of ISIS. But this is not simply a 
history book or political analysis, or even a war reporter’s journal. 
It’s a rare Autobiography of an ordinary Iraqi, whose path in life was 
forever altered by the decisions made in Washington, D.C. 20 years 
ago.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">I encourage everyone to pick up this 
book “A Stranger in Your Own City.” I devoured it in two days. It’s 
really that gripping.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Ghaith Abdul-Ahad joins us now from 
Istanbul, Turkey. Ghaith, thank you so much, not just for writing this 
book, but for joining us here on Intercepted.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">Ghaith Abdul-Ahad: </b>Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS:</b> I wanted to start, because 
as I read the first third of your book, I was so struck at how unusual 
and fascinating it is to read an account of a Gen X Iraqi who grew up in
 the totalitarian, authoritarian regime of Saddam Hussein, and just the 
human depiction of what life was like there. So, to begin, I would just 
really love to hear you describe your childhood and the impressions that
 you share from your life growing up during the reign of Saddam Hussein.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA: </b>I mean, full disclosure 
here Jeremy, I had a very boring childhood — minus the wars, I mean, the
 war with Iran, the war with the United States in 1991 — but as a child,
 as a family, it was very boring. None of my family was executed or 
oppressed by the regime. And none of us kind of joined the Ba?ath Party 
or the regime. So as a family, life was very boring.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But growing up under Saddam. I mean, 
he was everywhere — I mean, I cannot emphasize — everywhere. He was on 
TV, in school books, in classrooms. When I was a child, we used to watch
 this Japanese cartoon called Grendizer, and in my head, the hero of the
 cartoon, God, and Saddam were all the same person, because this is the 
person who’s saving Iraq. And of course, the narrative under Saddam, it 
goes back into the history, and it kind of borrows from everything in 
Iraqi mythology. So we were taught history in this kind of linear form. 
It starts with the Babylonian Assyrians, goes into the Arab conquerors, 
and now it is Saddam, the new manifestation of this great 5,000 years, 
history, nation.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So that was our life. And it was so dominated by Saddam. But it was 
also very boring, because he bored us to death. He bored the nation. I 
mean, every day you see him on TV, speeches about his glory; you have to
 write essays about how magnificent he is, and the revolution, and all 
these things. And everyone would tell jokes about him, of course, but we
 never used his name. We always said “Him” as the president.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH: </b>Can you talk a little bit 
about in the years leading up to the war, obviously, there were 
sanctions on Iraq, and they were very intense, and so forth. And you go 
into a bit [about it] in the book. Can you talk a bit about how 
sanctions start to change Iraqi society in the decade or so leading up 
to the invasion?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> So if the narrative was of
 this glorious history of Saddam, the conqueror, about our war with 
Iran, about this magnificent army and whatnot, the sanctions changed all
 of that. So the 1991 War was really hard on Iraq. But the sanctions 
really destroyed society. And it turned a middle class, secular nation 
into what I called a nation of hustlers. When a teacher is paid $2 a 
month, when a policeman is paid $1 a month — bribe, corruption, it 
became part of the society.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And again, the narrative of the state 
changed. And now Saddam became the tribal leader, because his security 
forces were weak. So he needed new tools to control society. And these 
came from religion, because religiosity was sweeping through them, at 
least in the ’90s, and he wanted to utilize the religion. So he created 
this faith campaign in which he became the faithful the commander of the
 whatnot, and he utilized this religious language, non-sectarian, but 
very strong religious language, building mosques, campaigns to memorize 
the Quran and whatnot, but also strengthen the tribe. And these became 
his own tools to control society.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Another thing which, as someone who 
grew up under sanctions, the sanctions prolonged the life of the regime.
 Because before people could work, or travel, could have a life. During 
the sanctions, the only access to any form of largesse came through 
Saddam himself and the circle around his family. And suddenly he 
dominated everything. So I would argue that it was the sanctions that 
prolonged the life of Saddam; otherwise, you would have been toppled by a
 coup, by an uprising, or anything else.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>Ghaith, I started going to 
Iraq in 1997, 1998, when Saddam was still in power, and I was a very 
inexperienced young radio journalist. And I wasn’t well-versed in the 
epic history of Iraq, or even so much in the political dynamics between 
Iraq and Iran, the United States and Saddam. I was in high school when 
the so-called Gulf War — other people would refer to it as the second 
Gulf War, but what the American public understands as the 1991 Gulf War —
 and I knew that the United States had systematically destroyed Iraqi 
civilian infrastructure. But then as a young adult arriving in Iraq with
 a humanitarian delegation, much of what I did over the course of five 
years of going in and out of Iraq was touring Iraqi hospitals all 
throughout the country, and interviewing ordinary Iraqis. I wasn’t doing
 interviews with big, famous political people. And I had this sense in 
these hospitals that they were being converted into death rows for 
infants; that you had very brilliant Iraqi doctors, who, one after the 
other in different cities would tell you the same thing: That we know 
how to treat this ailment that our patients have, or we know what we 
should be doing, but we don’t have the basic medicines — we don’t even 
have analgesics, we have to perform operations with no 
painkillers.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">The hospitals reeked of petrol because
 the hospital workers were using gasoline to clean the floors because of
 the ban on the importation of all sorts of goods.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And then — and this is what I want to ask you about — under Bill 
Clinton in the 1990s, you had his Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
confronted on national television in the United States on the program 
“60 Minutes” about reports of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children 
dying as a direct result of the sanctions, and then Albright famously 
said that it’s a difficult question, but ultimately, it’s worth the 
price.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And I’m wondering, now in retrospect, 
your sense of the ultimate result of this economic war that the U.S. 
claimed to be waging against Saddam Hussein’s regime and who it actually
 harmed the most?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> I mean, that sentence, “I 
think it’s worth it,” it kind of rings in the head of every single Iraqi
 since that day. Of course, the regime continued to live. I mean, Saddam
 started building his palaces, his sons were building their own palaces,
 his son-in-law — that clique, that regime circle, like in any other 
kind of dictatorship at the moment under sanctions, the circle around 
the leadership will continue to thrive. On the contrary, the black 
market created so much wealth for these people during the sanctions 
years. So much money was created by the black market and access to the 
kind of imported foreign goods.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">It was the normal Iraqis, it was 
people like us, who were just suddenly crushed. I mean, I was studying 
architecture and school, I would scavenge corridors and old drawers 
looking for used paper so I could draw on its back. It affected our 
lives, affected our electricity, affected the schools, affected the 
hospitals, as you say.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And of course, the regime, the 
narrative of the regime, was these are American-imposed sanctions — 
which were American-imposed sanctions. So comes the moment in 2003 when 
the invasion was happening, the Iraqis have already been bombed by the 
Americans and had been going for 13 years of sanctions — 
American-imposed sanctions — so I cannot emphasize the anger that was 
already there towards this country that had already caused so much pain 
for Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And of course, Saddam was a mad 
dictator: Saddam invaded Kuwait; Saddam started a war with Iran. All of 
these things Saddam did. But it was us Iraqis who were paying the price 
on a daily basis.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH: </b>So that brings me to the 
next question, too, when the Americans invaded. Obviously, in your book,
 you talk about how they exposed a lot of divisions in Iraqi society, 
and slowly, over time, those divisions became more salient. Can you tell
 us a bit about the initial reaction among Iraqis to the invasion or to 
the arrival of U.S. troops in the country? What can we say about it?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA: </b>I think every Iraqi, 
myself included, had this Faustian deal. We hated Saddam so much. Did we
 want to be occupied? No. Did anyone ask our opinion? No. But when that 
happened, when the war was happening, I think — and when the statue 
fell, and when we realized that Saddam was toppled — I think every 
person I talked to personally, even people in the army, people in his 
own hometown, were very happy to get rid of Saddam. Saddam was, again, a
 deranged, mad dictator, leading us from one war to another, from one 
crisis to another, just kind of stealing the life of a nation for three 
decades.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">That is on one level. But when the 
occupation happened, when the people realized that not only the 
Americans had no plan for the day after, they had no plan to secure the 
streets — the looting, the burning, the destruction of the 
infrastructure, whatever that was not destroyed before — the looting of 
the museum, all of these things — suddenly the Iraqis, who were willing 
to turn a tiny little blind eye to what America had done to Iraq, 
suddenly that exploded in anger.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And that is half of the destruction of
 Iraq. The second half of the destruction came with the sectarian 
narrative. The sectarian narrative pushed by Iraqi politicians in exile 
because they were suffering from Sudan, they had their own mentality, it
 kind of imagined Iraq as made of three components: Sunnis, Shia, and 
Kurds. And I don’t want to say that Sunnis, and Shia, and Kurds do not 
exist in Iraq. Of course, they exist. But that sectarian identity had 
melted away in the last three, four decades. When I went to school, I 
still don’t know if half of the kids in my school were Sunni or Shia, 
because it was not emphasized anymore: inter-sectarian marriages, and 
interethnic marriages were common. The sectarian narrative is based on 
victimhood.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So if one part of the nation has a 
[Arabic: ‘mindstet’] of victimhood, then that means the other part of 
the nation are victimizers. And then suddenly, all the Sunnis of Iraq 
are, by association, told that you’re all guilty because Saddam was 
Sunni — although many Sunnis were against Saddam. I mean, so many coup 
d’états against him were done by the Sunni army officers. Anyhow: All 
the Sunnis are in a corner, you are guilty. And now it is those people 
who will be ruling Iraq. That created a split within the society. And 
that split was the beginning of civil war; a civil war doesn’t start 
when people start shooting at each other across the street. It starts 
when this society is divided along sectarian or ethnic or whatever 
lines.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH:</b> It’s a very tragic scene in
 the book, it’s very brief. But there’s a woman who you visit, and her 
sons have been killed by death squads who are Shia, but then in her 
house, she had Shia iconography on the walls. And you mentioned that 
she’s from the pre-sectarian age in Iraq, which I think speaks to what 
you’re describing the change of people’s identities under the war. Very 
briefly, you mentioned something about the exiles who came back to Iraq,
 who were sort of contributing to the growth of that victim narrative, 
as you said. Can you speak a bit more about that, and what the influence
 of exiles were in Iraq? I know many of them played important roles in 
Iraqi politics.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> It played a very important
 role; it still plays a very important role. I mean, it’s the same 
clique that came 20 years ago, it’s still ruling Iraq now. So those 
exiles evolved their identity in exile in London, in Tehran, and 
whatnot. Most of them were actually from families oppressed by the 
regime, the regime did not tolerate any kind of opposition, let alone 
religious-based opposition. And of course, the sheer political parties 
were severely oppressed and thousands of people were killed and 
prisoned. So they went to Iran, or London, other places, and evolved 
into this claustrophobic kind of paranoid way of thinking.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And the process of toppling Saddam did
 not start, of course, after 2001. The Iraq regime project started since
 the ’90s, since Clinton time. And they had pushed this narrative for a 
long time, because what is there to justify toppling Saddam? Oppressing 
the nation! Of course, he was oppressing the nation, but it was not on 
sectarian lines. He did not oppress the Shia, more than the Sunnis. Yes,
 he did not trust certain parts of the population, the Shia; he trusted 
his own clan, which happens to be Sunni. But in the ’90s, for example, 
he did not tolerate the Sunni political Islam. So suddenly, the 
oppression turned against the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafis, and 
whatnot.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Now, those people in exile who 
suddenly were the Iraqis that the Americans were talking to. They are 
the Iraqis. If they want to consult something about Iraq, they will go 
to those people in exile. And they consulted them about Iraq. And those 
[people] had their own agenda, their own program. They wanted to take 
revenge on the population inside because they thought we were all 
collaborators with Saddam, but they also had no idea of the country. 
They were mistrusted by the Iraqis inside.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And that mentality of those exiles, I 
would severely blame for creating a handicapped constitution, and 
creating this political system we have in Iraq, which we call Muhasasa. 
That is the division of the state among the different political players.
 So the Shia would take this percentage, the Sunnis this percentage, and
 the Kurds that, but of course, these are not the Shia of the Shia on 
the streets. These are certain political Shia parties who will dominate 
certain ministries, create a patronage system that would enable them to 
win the next election. Same thing with the Sunnis: These are not the 
Sunnis of Ramadi or Fallujah, who are fighting the Americans. These are 
Sunni politicians, or tribal elders, who would again benefit from the 
state patronage.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Twenty years later, we have one of the
 most corrupt states in the world; one of the wealthiest — not the 
wealthiest, but a very wealthy nation with $120 billion. And yet such 
corruption enabled by the political system of Muhasasa allows a tiny 
little elite to siphon the wealth of the nation.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS:</b> In the book, Ghaith, and I 
hope everyone picks up this book and reads it, one of the things that 
are really outstanding is you weave in your personal story and your 
personal journey. You were not a journalist by training or trade when 
the invasion began; you, in fact, were an architect. And you describe 
how you were working, taking on projects to make money building ugly 
houses for ugly people and trying to scrap together what you could to 
support yourself and your family. But you then sort of accidentally 
become a journalist and work your way up in the journalistic system. 
Talk a little bit about how you ended up in journalism.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA: </b>So I started journalism, 
by accident — the accidental journalist is the word I’m using. The day 
the statue fell, I was in Baghdad, I was in my apartment, and I saw the 
Americans down in my street and they were the Marines with these kind of
 amphibious armored vehicles. I followed them a short distance into the 
square where the statue was pulled. And something inside me wanted to go
 walk into Saddam’s palace. I still don’t know why. Maybe I thought I’ll
 find answers in the corridors; I will learn my history; why Saddam did 
to us what he did.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Anyhow, I walked the next day, I was 
carrying a backpack. My English convinced Americans I was British, 
probably because any English for them that’s not American is weird. So 
they let me pass. And then I was in front of the gate of the palace. And
 there was this armored vehicle and a tired soldier. I mean, again, I 
cannot describe that feeling. We couldn’t stop in front of the Saddam 
palace gate. You couldn’t pose there, let alone take a picture. And 
there it was — the gate and an American soldier. So I went inside. I 
walked into the palace. The Americans were so nice. They gave me a tour 
of the palace. I saw the massive dining rooms, the opulence in the 
bedrooms, and whatnot.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And I wanted to leave, I wanted to 
walk across the second bridge, because it’s kind of a semi-peninsula. 
And the Americans told me no, you can’t, because there’s still some 
resistance and fighting at the Ba?ath Party headquarters down the road. 
So I went back and I saw this red SUV coming and I tried to hitch a 
ride; I hitched a ride. And there are two British journalists working 
for The Guardian. And I ended up working as their translator. And I’m so
 lucky that I was working with one of the most amazing writers, James 
Meek at The Guardian, which I love, and that’s how I started.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But you know, something else started 
that day. So I’m an Iraqi, all my understanding of Iraq comes from 
inside, you know, whatever reading I was doing; I had no access to the 
outside world. And in the early days, when I was translating for the 
journalists, and they asked me this question: Can you ask this family, 
are they Sunnis or Shia? And I would be shocked in the beginning. It’s 
like: Why would they ask them that question? What difference does it 
make if they’re asking about their conditions, their life? What 
difference does it make if they’re Sunni or Shia? And I was shocked in 
the beginning, sometimes I wouldn’t translate this question, honestly, 
in the beginning. But later on, within a few months, that way of 
thinking seeped into my brain. So I started recording when I save 
someone’s number on my phone, I would write Sunni or Shia and it took me
 years — until the story that Murtaza talks about, about this woman — 
when you realize this narrative of Sunni or Shia was a kind of a very 
important narrative.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Again, I emphasize: There are Sunnis, 
there are Shia, they had been fighting for 1,500 years, they might fight
 for another 1,500 years. But that’s a cultural religious identity. It 
was not a social identity in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">It took me years to come out of this 
way of seeing the conflict as a conflict between Sunnis and Shia and to 
realize that the conflict in reality was a collection of a smaller 
conflict; people would use religious justification, avenging Ali or 
avenging Omar to kill, to raid, to loot, because basically, I want to 
take that house and whatever religious justification I can use, I can 
use it to take the house.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>I wanted to also, on that 
front, before we get into the descent into civil war, and the role of 
the United States, the role of tribal politics, the beginning stages of 
al Qaeda in Iraq and Mesopotamia and ultimately ISIS, I first want to 
just start at sort of the beginning of this part of the chapter. And 
that is you have the Bush administration, sending in Paul Bremer, who 
cut his teeth working under Henry Kissinger, and you had this shock 
doctrine, as Naomi Klein would call it, where you had political 
ideologues, Republicans from the United States, who not only wanted to 
redraw maps in the Middle East but had this idea that they could create a
 sort of Baghdad year zero where they would build up this free market 
society. And it could be an example for other American-imposed 
governments now in the Middle East, and Bremer comes in and one of the 
first thing he does is enacts a de-Ba‘athification policy, and they end 
up firing the bulk of the Iraqi army and sending scores and scores of 
so-called military age males onto the streets with no job. And you, 
during this time, as the insurgency is starting to bubble, are working 
as a journalist, and you have to find a way, now in your own city, to 
navigate from one area to the next as walls are being erected, as the 
U.S. media and the U.S. regime and Iraq is starting to really fan the 
flames of this notion that there are strict divisions between Sunnis and
 Shia and Kurds. And you, then, as a sort of budding journalist, 
although a very well-educated and sharp Iraqi have to now figure out how
 to navigate a city that you’ve been able to go around your entire life —
 talk about that dynamic and what you had to do just to get from one end
 of Baghdad to the other and stay alive.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA: </b>So basically — and I just 
saw that he had published a piece today saying what went well in Iraq — 
what Bremer did is by enacting the kind of the firing of the army and 
sending all these security forces back to their home, and the 
de-Ba‘athification. It was not a general kind of de-Ba‘athification 
across the board, it was very well targeted toward the Sunni community. 
So suddenly de-Ba‘athification, and this whole army thing, becomes a way
 to target the Sunnis and a tool to target the Sunnis, which of course, 
creates opposition, which, of course, creates resistance, which leads to
 violence in the street, and the beginning was violence targeting the 
Americans.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But the security vacuum created by 
this occupation — the Americans never controlled the borders — allows 
anyone who has a grievance against the Americans to come and fight the 
Americans in Iraq. So you see, the jihad is flowing into Iraq, we had no
 jihadis before, the jihad is coming on with Musab al-Zarqawi people 
from as far as Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, finding refuge in Iraq 
and the tribal belt to fight the Americans.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">The Iranians at the time, also started
 — why would we wait for the Americans to come and fight us in Iran? Why
 don’t we make sure that they fail in Iraq? So they start supporting 
Shia militias, and of course, that eventually leads to civil war.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Now, I grew up in Baghdad. I rarely 
left the city. For 28 years, I was basically stuck in the city. I tried 
to leave the country, tried to smuggle myself out of the country, but 
failed. So here I am, 28 years of my life and this one city that I 
almost know — like, I can memorize the map by heart. And within two 
years, the city is divided, at first not by walls, at first by gunman, 
by militiaman, by the pictures on the wall, and you realize that this is
 a Shia part of town, that is a Sunni part of town, cleansing is taking 
place, Sunnis cannot go to certain parts of the city, Shia cannot 
go.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So how do you negotiate this, as a 
journalist who needs to go to both parts? You end up, I mean, basically,
 a stranger in your own city. You need someone to vouch for you to go 
into that neighborhood, someone to vouch for you to go into that 
neighborhood. And of course, I ended up carrying a set of fake ID cards 
with different mothers, with different tribal names. One to insinuate a 
Sunni identity, one to insinuate a Shia identity, never very clear, 
because you don’t know who the gunmen at the end of the streets are, you
 have to always approach them carefully, exchange a few words to know if
 they’re Sunni or Shia. That was the madness that became life in 
Baghdad.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And of course, as a journalist, I do 
these trips to work. But people lived through these things. People had 
to go to work, had to shop, had to get married, had to have their life 
within this divided sectarian city. And again, it was divided and 
sectarian by the militiamen and the gunman who controlled the streets, 
not by the majority of the people who lived their life in the city.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>To what extent do you 
think, based on your experience and your journalism, was it an official 
part of the U.S. strategy in Iraq during this period to emphasize those 
divisions or that classification of neighborhoods and people as Sunni 
and Shia? Did you get a sense that this was a program? Or did you get a 
sense that it was ad hoc, and the United States was trying to get its 
bearings because it clearly didn’t understand tribal structures in Iraq,
 it didn’t understand much of what you’re saying about social versus 
other identification? But did you get a sense that the U.S. was adopting
 this as a strategy to kind of consolidate its control?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> I mean, look, Jeremy, all 
imperial powers would use one part of the population against the other. I
 mean, the British did that in India. And we see what that led to. So of
 course, the Americans would — I mean, you know, some of the people who 
created these Ministry of Interior special forces, had that same, that 
same experiment in Latin America during the wars in Salvador and 
Nicaragua, so they brought that experience with them, these people who 
kind of had the beginning under Reagan in the ’80s, and then the ’90s 
under Bush, they brought it to Iraq. And of course, when they found that
 one part of the population, thanks to their policies, was opposing 
them, was fighting against them, of course they would turn to the other 
part of the population.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And this is why we ended up with 
security forces that are heavily infiltrated by Iranian-trained 
militias. I mean, how crazy this is to give the whole Ministry of 
Interior and the Ministry of Interior Special Forces, trained, equipped 
by the Americans, to militia men who were trained and ideologically 
allied to Iran.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And of course, these militias would 
work in tandem with the militias, with the mighty army and another thing
 to target Sunni population. It was no longer a fight against Sunni 
insurgents; it was a fight to quote-unquote protect the Shia 
neighborhoods, to cleanse the Shia neighborhood from the threat of the 
other. And that was happening right under the eyes of the 
Americans.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So, I mean, probably it’s criminal negligence, but I mean, how 
idiotic do you have to be as an Army officer general to not see what was
 going on in the ground, but setting up the ground for a civil war?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH: </b>In the book, you 
segmentally divide it into a first civil war and a second civil war in 
Iraq. Can you talk about the relationship between the two and then how 
the first conflict fed to the other, which was the one that featured, as
 everyone knows, ISIS?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> So by the end of this 
process, the Sunnis were defeated, basically. They were defeated in 
Baghdad, they fled the city, they went to exile, to Amman, to others, 
but the insurgency itself — and I don’t mean the jihadi kind of 
insurgency, but the Iraqi insurgency that started in the beginning to 
resist and oppose the Americans — they realized they cannot fight three 
enemies at the same time. And I’ve been told that by so many of their 
commanders: We’re fighting the Americans, we’re fighting the Shia 
militias, and of course, there was the conflict within the Sunni 
insurgency between the jihadis and the nationalist movements.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So they realize at one point that 
their real enemy is not the United States with the Shia militias because
 — again, this is a sentence I had so many times — the Americans would 
pack one day and leave, but it’s us who will be stuck here with these 
militias.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So another Faustian deal comes in 
which the Sunni insurgents would ally themselves to the Americans, 
defeat the jihadists for the price of the Americans protecting them, 
stopping the militias from attacking them, and then reintegrating them 
into society. A lot has been made about Petraeus’ surge and I think the 
defeat of the insurgency did not happen because of the surge; it 
happened because the Sunni insurgency itself decided to split and fight 
the jihadis.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And then you had a point in 2008 and 2009 in which history could have
 changed. The insurgency was over, those former insurgents came to the 
government and said: Payment time — can we get integrated back into the 
state? Can we have our role back into society? Instead, the Americans 
directly supported Nouri al-Maliki’s bid to become prime minister for a 
second time, although he lost in the elections by a small margin, they 
supported him to stay in power, thinking that this is our man. The 
Americans wanted to leave Iraq by 2009; they thought al-Maliki is our 
man that we can work with.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">al-Maliki turned out to be a worse 
sectarian version than the militias themselves. Because al-Maliki’s 
version of sectarianism was taking over the state itself. He went after 
the insurgency, and other former insurgents, al-Sahaba were called. He 
went after the leaders, he went after Sunni politicians; consolidated 
his powers, weakened the state, and created this patronage system in 
which people bought positions in the army. People would pay $150,000 to 
become an army commander, as long as he was loyal to al-Maliki.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And how did he get his money back? By 
inflating the number of soldiers. So al-Maliki kind of weakened the 
security forces just for the sole purpose of creating a patronage 
system, ensuring the loyalty of army officers, ensuring the loyalty of 
other kinds of tribesmen and tribal elders, and that sectarianism, that 
marginalization of the Sunnis the second time, happened at the time of 
the Arab Spring, and you have the sectarian issues in Iraq now going to 
Syria, you have the security vacuum on the border, in which al Qaeda can
 regroup, rearrange themselves, come back to Iraq, and this time calling
 themselves the Islamic State.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS:</b> I was saying Max as we were
 discussing your book before we got on to speak with you about your 
description of Nouri al-Maliki and his reign — and of course, to the 
extent that Americans pay attention to this stuff, he was very clearly 
America’s choice. The U.S. government was constantly boosting him and 
promoting him and referring to him as building the new stable future of 
Iraq, but I just want to read a couple of quotes from your book. And I 
think it’s really important for people to understand the role of Nouri 
al-Maliki in creating the conditions that led to the end of your book, 
which is about the rise and fall of ISIS in Iraq — and, to an extent, 
Syria.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But you’re describing — and this is 
this period from 2009 to 2011 — you write: “Iraq, a nation that still 
yearns for the brutal days of Saddam and calls them the days of safety 
and security, the lines between strong and authoritarian are often 
blurred.”&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">In another section, you write: “Six 
years after the toppling of the dictator, a few hundred thousand Iraqis 
killed a brutal insurgency, trillions of dollars wasted, and 5,000 dead 
U.S. soldiers, the country was being rebuilt on the same model of a 
concentration of unaccountable power, shadowy intelligence services, and
 corruption.”&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And then you note that by 2010, both 
the United States and Iran were supporting Nouri al-Maliki’s illicit 
effort to stay in power after losing the election. And you write that 
both the U.S. and Iran were backing him because, “he had become their 
chief ally” in the case of Iran, and the U.S. because they were planning
 to withdraw and didn’t want to disturb the status quo. And al-Maliki 
has been waging this war of revenge and annihilation against Sunnis 
while building up or consolidating the sort of sectarian nature of the 
national army. Talk about that moment, and then how we start to see the 
rise of the Islamic State in Iraq.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA: </b>So al-Maliki was trying to
 rebuild this authoritarian regime. And it’s a yearning that people have
 in times of disasters, in times of civil wars, they yearn to be the 
strong man, because they think, foolishly, that a strong man would solve
 the problems. I mean, this is why people, they thought: At least under 
Saddam we didn’t have sectarianism. Or: At least under Saddam the 
schools were functioning and whatnot.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And al-Maliki played that kind of 
card. He showed himself as a strong leader. But of course, he was a 
tiger made out of paper, even empty paper, because the security 
services, although very brutal — torturing, kidnapping — I mean, in this
 period between the two civil wars, the security forces were becoming, 
they took the role of the militia, so they will kidnap 20-30 men and put
 them in jail, torture them until the families would pay and release 
them. And they tend to be Sunnis, of course.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So he really soiled the image of the 
Iraqi security forces, people were calling them al-Maliki’s Army. And 
that is the condition that he created. But also the security forces were
 also hollow from the inside. So when the shock came, when the attack 
happened, they crumbled very quickly, because they had no belief in 
nationalism. The army officers were there just to make money, the 
soldiers were there just to make money. There was nothing that can 
resist a tiny little push by a group of jihadis on pickup trucks. This 
is why the collapse happened so quickly.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And this was, again, a very short-sighted American policy and error, 
thinking that let’s enable another strong man, let’s turn a blind eye to
 all the atrocities is committing against the public. Let’s turn a blind
 eye to corruption. And then, just so we can leave in peace, and then 
the whole collapse happened. When ISIS came in, the Iraqi army collapsed
 and whatnot, and when the Americans started retraining and 
restructuring these basically broken Iraqi army brigades, but these were
 the same American army brigades that were first created by Americans, 
were first trained by the Americans, were first equipped by the 
Americans. It was mind-boggling how America had again failed in creating
 an army, a national army, for the countries they occupy.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH: </b>So you described a bit 
there, the origins of ISIS, or its ascendance and the conditions it 
ascended. Can you speak a bit more about the local dynamics that 
actually led to the creation of the emergence of ISIS in Iraq? Because 
in the U.S. and abroad, there’s a particular narrative that’s a bit 
simplistic, but in your book, you talk a lot about the different 
threads. Tell us a bit about how ISIS came to be and to reemerge with 
the role it had by 2014.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> To understand ISIS, you 
have to see it in the context of the Arab Spring. The Arab Spring, which
 started as this beautiful moment when the people poured into the 
streets, denouncing their dictators, denouncing the oppression, 
denouncing decades of corruption was quickly captured — at least in 
countries like Iraq, Syria, and Yemen — by the same sectarian narrative 
that was first created in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So you see these gulf countries — Qatar, Saudi Arabia — their TV 
channels suddenly borrowing language that they were using in Iraq. So 
suddenly, it is the Shia army of Assad versus the tribesmen of Syria — 
kind of injecting sectarianism into it. It’s not only them, of course, 
the sectarian dynamics were also there on the ground. But that’s 
sectarian, the quick movement of the Syrian Civil Syrian uprising, to 
the Syrian Civil War, to sectarian civil war, created this dynamic 
somewhere in the middle of these oil-rich regions in the east for the 
jihadis to come back. Suddenly, you have, again, all these battalions, 
Syrian battalions funded, equipped by the CIA, the Pentagon, the French,
 the British, the Saudis, everyone was funding a battalion of their own.
 And in the case of these battalions, the jihadis emerged as 
disciplined, as well-equipped, and were good to the civilians.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And this is the trump card they played
 every single time: In the time of chaos, the jihadis emerge as the 
people who would save the civilians, same dynamic in Yemen, and Somalia,
 whatnot.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Anyhow, they restructure themselves; 
they re-equip themselves. In neighboring Iraq, the Sunni towns, again, 
start with popular demonstrations — for the first time the Sunnis 
realize that they can have a peaceful solution to the problems that they
 had since 2003. They went into demonstrations, they made a protest camp
 in Ramadi and other towns; their demands were very basic in the 
beginning. They wanted to end the oppression, reintegrate into the 
society, and release female prisoners — all could have been achieved and
 done. But al Maliki’s mentality, and the people around him, saw it as a
 Ba‘ath plot to come back to power. Yes, of course, the Ba‘athis where 
they are and tribesmen and insurgents and everyone were there in these 
kinds of demonstration camps. But the demands were genuine, were really 
popular, genuine.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">The jihadis entered this dynamic of 
the Sunni uprising against al-Maliki and the short-sighted tribal 
leaders, insurgents thought they can use the jihadis to defeat Maliki. 
And then then, of course, they will control them because of course, 
they’ve been doing it all along — and they failed in 2003. And they will
 fail again. And the jihadis came into the dynamic, controlled Fallujah,
 controlled Ramadi. And then within one year, the unbelievable thing 
happened: Mosul, Iraq’s Second City toppled within two days. I spoke 
with Army officers and soldiers who just fled — fled because there was 
no command, there was no command structure. So many weapons, American 
weapons, and American equipment fell into the hands of the jihadis 
because the soldiers did not fight because they did not believe in their
 leaders.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS:</b> One of the most powerful 
chapters or sections of the book is when you tell this story of the fall
 of Mosul, which, of course, within Iraq, was considered to be a wealthy
 place, a stable place. You had a lot of businessmen and important 
tribal figures that lived there; it was economically well off relative 
to other parts of Iraq and you, you weave between two personal stories 
of individuals that you met in Mosul: One is the story of a woman who 
was a doctor, and she shares with you how she was able to function under
 the Islamic State rule and ultimately culminates with her smuggling or 
stealing medical supplies from the hospital that were intended only to 
in use for the Islamic State Personnel, their fighters, and their 
families. And she essentially converts part of her private home into an 
operating room; she delivers babies on a dining room table. I mean, it’s
 a gut-wrenching, personal story.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And then you also interview a man who 
shared with you, who’s a very well-educated man — a scientist, I believe
 — portions of his personal diary. And you also referenced the German 
writer Hans Fallada, who was writing about life under the Nazis and sort
 of what was going through the heads of his characters. But you share 
the personal diaries of, for all practical purposes, an ordinary guy, as
 he watches and lives through this transformation. Talk more about what 
happened then as people went — almost literally overnight — from one set
 of rules under this chaotic American occupation, Nouri al-Maliki’s 
government, to all of a sudden you have these fighters coming in and 
implementing their own radical program.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> It’s a very good point 
because life in Mosul, the change did not happen overnight. So 
al-Maliki’s army collapsed, the Iraqi army collapsed, and it fled and 
left the city. And suddenly the people of Mosul believed that they were 
free because those new gunmen — no one knew who they were. Some called 
them tribesmen, some called them rebels. And in the beginning, for the 
first two months, life was okay for the people of Mosul, as long as you 
were mainstream Sunni and did not involve yourself in politics. But of 
course, as life was, quote-unquote normal for the people, changes were 
happening in society. And all these radical movements, they start by 
purging the society of any threat, and then gradually implementing set 
after set of regulations. First, they target the Christians, and they 
target the minorities, the Shia and the others, and then they start 
confiscating their property.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">And you know, Hans Fallada talks about
 this very well in describing life in Berlin, in Nazi Berlin. At the 
beginning, people say: Oh, as long as it’s not targeting me, it’s fine. 
As long as I can keep going to my job and keep having my family out, 
it’s fine. And, oh, it’s my Jewish neighbor. So it’s fine. It’s the 
leftist, it’s the communists. The same thing happened in Mosul. And only
 people realize how horrible the situation is when suddenly ISIS could 
control the life of everyone — be it Sunni, be it Shia, be it Christian,
 everyone becomes a prisoner. They have to pray in a way; they have to 
live their lives according to the regulations of maniacal, mad 
organizations.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Now, that also has another dynamic. The majority of the people, they 
just lowered their head and survived. Some like the scientists just 
observed and wrote his diary, but he never tried to do anything — like 
the majority of the people were just trying to survive, find enough 
money to buy cigarettes, feed his family, and go on. But others, a very 
tiny minority — of course, others collaborated — so people benefited 
from ISIS rule because they brought oil from Syria, they started 
business; ISIS was a very capitalist enterprise. You want to do 
business, you do business; you want to import, you want to export, you 
want to do business with Turkey, with Syria, with anyone, it’s fine, as 
long as you pay us our taxes. And that way, ISIS was this kind of 
culmination of a militant terrorist organization, plus very capitalist.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But then a very small minority, like 
the doctor who tried to resist, and she resisted in the way she could by
 enabling others to have access to medicine that was hoarded by ISIS to 
only treat their foreign fighters and the foreign families and the 
jihadis who had joined them. She basically created her own clinic in her
 house. And she resisted in these tiny little ways by throwing parties 
and music for cancer patients, for children suffering from cancer. And 
that was her act of resistance.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Others tried to do different forms of 
resistance, this painter who just wants to try to stay sane, he hides 
his children, locks them in a room, and two years later, the youngest 
two, they forgot how they lost the capacity to speak, because that was 
the terror of the people of Mosul. So when this moment happened, when 
the liberation of Mosul happened, it was deliberate. It was the moment 
when sectarianism ended in Iraq, for a brief moment, when Shia, Special 
Forces guys, soldiers, policemen were welcomed by the Sunnis of Mosul 
because that is the moment when the whole of Iraqis realized what 
sectarianism had done to Iraq. It’s like you have a nuclear weapon, and 
you use it. And then you have the impact of a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Again, the Sunnis of Mosul did not 
convert to Shi’ism. They’re still Sunnis. And the Shia soldiers went to 
fight in Mosul to liberate the people of Mosul who did not become 
Sunnis. They were Shia. But it was a moment when everyone had a common 
enemy. And that enemy was so deranged, that it unified the Iraqis in 
this tiny, beautiful moment of solidarity.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">MH:</b> Towards the end of the book
 you talk about a couple of years ago in Iraq, there was another wave of
 protests — and there were many young people — about the economic 
conditions of the country, which are still very dire. So can you talk a 
bit about the kleptocracy, as you’ve described it, which currently is 
still embedded in Iraq, and what the consequences continue to be for 
Iraqis?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> So starting with the 
defeat of ISIS and the emergence of this new Iraqi — I don’t want to 
call it national identity, but it is kind of a trans-sectarian identity.
 Suddenly, people realized that this whole sectarian division had led to
 so much bloodshed, culminating again in ISIS, and by 2017-18, I would 
say sectarianism almost disappeared from Iraq; it became a shame to use 
sectarian terminology. The politicians who had built their power on 
sectarian rhetoric suddenly found themselves — they couldn’t use the 
same terminology.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But also the defeat of ISIS led to 
this point, when, with the emergence of this new national identity, with
 the emergence of a new consciousness, it lead to this realization that 
hold on — the Sunnis don’t have electricity, and we don’t have 
electricity, too, as Shia, the Kurds are maybe doing better.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">But it is all of the rest of Iraq that
 is suffering from corruption, lack of services. And why are we living 
in these conditions? Because this kleptocratic coalition of sectarian 
politicians, corrupt businessmen, government officials, are siphoning so
 much of the national wealth. I mean there are parts of Baghdad today; I
 mean Iraq has an average of $120 billion a year budget for the last 20 
years. And there are parts of Iraq today that are on par with some of 
the poorest nations in the world, let alone parts of the south of Iraq, 
and this whole sectarian narrative, it is the Shia now that are going to
 benefit because the Sunnis, Saddam’s people, were benefiting before.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Twenty years later and the Shia have 
the same poverty; the schools are wretched, the hospital systems are 
broken, there is no electricity — so hold on, that whole sectarian 
narrative did not work. And that led to again, a bright moment in, I 
would say, modern Iraqi history, these youth that kind of spilled into 
the street, calling for two things: We want a homeland, we want to take 
back our homeland from those people. And they denounced both Iran and 
America, accusing both of fighting the wars on Iraqi soil.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">So that was a beautiful moment of 
Iraqi national consciousness, I would say. And of course, it did not 
change the political system. It did not end the rule of the kleptocracy,
 because popular uprising cannot do that. But it established a moment, 
established a reference point in which the people can do something if 
they’re united and go to the street.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Twenty years on, what do we have? We 
have this mutant state. It’s a country that has oil wealth, but it’s 
poor. It has a constitution that guarantees freedom of thought, and yet,
 it uses the same Penal Code established by the Ba‘aths in 1969. The 
space for freedom of expression is eroding — and the social division, 
the kind of social crisis we have in Iraq because of corruption, it 
threatens another severe explosion.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">I mean, if you see the modern history 
of Iraq, every 2030 years, we have this explosion, because our narrative
 changes. So we have something until the ’50s, monarchy; then we have a 
republic; then it’s a socialist republic; then it’s a strongman, Saddam;
 and then a sectarian regime. And because none of these rulers realize 
the challenges they’re facing, realize how far they are from the 
society, a collapse happens.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">Saddam did not react to what he did to Iraq by the ’90s. And that led
 to his demise in 2003. The same thing is happening now in Iraq. If 
these politicians, religious parties, and their militias do not realize 
the gap, the challenges facing Iraq at the moment, it will lead to 
another explosion and another round of violence within the next — I 
don’t know — within the next decade.</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">JS: </b>Ghaith, we only have a 
couple of minutes left. But we are now this month, remembering 20 years 
since the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. What do you think are 
the most important realities for particularly the American and British 
public to understand because they led this war, about the legacy of what
 their governments did by invading Iraq on the basis of lies?</p>

	<p class="bodtxt"><b class="hlt1">GAA:</b> So if I can quickly 
narrate this anecdote, I was in Baghdad last week, and I was hanging out
 with this notorious kind of murderer, a hero of the sectarian civil 
war; had killed hundreds, and his name became synonymous with the worst 
atrocities in Iraq. And he was driving around Baghdad in his SUV; he was
 showing me around his neighborhood. He faced no accountability. There 
is no accountability in Iraq; no accountability to the people who 
devised the war, who led the war. The people who killed Iraqis. Iraq is 
all foreign. This is the legacy 20 years on. Without accountability, 
without holding those people accountable to the crimes they did in Iraq,
 whether outsiders or insiders, we will never have healing. The trauma 
will continue to regenerate itself.&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="bodtxt">I don’t want those people to go to 
jail— although I would love to see an International Court of Justice 
putting those people on trial — but what I want is accountability for 
the people to be held accountable for the crimes they committed against 
the Iraqi people.</p>
